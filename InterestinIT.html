		<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
		<p> One of my biggest interests in the world of IT is the way it challenges my mind to reach and end goal and working on putting things together piece by piece just like a puzzle, then seeing the result of supporting someone’s day or making someone’s life better or helping a student engage in a standard environment. </p>
		<h2>When did your interst start?</h2>
		<p>My interest in IT first started when I was around 6 years old it was when I saw my uncle build the first PC in the house making it a possibility for my family to complete tasks more efficiently, watching my grandmother smile that she didn’t have to write out the same thing each year and instead put it into an excel document.</p>
		<h2>Why did i choose RMIT?</h2>
		<p>The reason I choose RMIT is because I really wanted a UNI that gave me what really matters, the option to be able to study at the end of the work day, the ability to work online reducing the stresses of making it on time to class or walking into the right room and giving me the ability to see if I can truly manage my time and work load to successful complete a group of tasks and assignments.</p>
		<h2>What do i inted to learn during my studies?</h2>
	<p>Throughout this Bachelor of Information Technology, I hope to improve on my general knowledge which can always be expanded upon, I plan on practicing and learning new skills in the time management, programming, web-dev & social interactions as a team to complete a task.</p>
